# EnronDataSet_MachineLearning
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives, entered the public record.  Here we would like to build a machine learning model aiming to identify "persons of interest (POI)" within Enron employees, i.e., persons who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.
